# Hello-World-
My first repository on GitHub
I want to develop a "group texting" application that uses SMS and mobile phones only (doesn't <require? a computer, but oe can be used to send texts or create emails that provide more details.
The Group Text app should have a few designated "message senders" and should be able to send SMS texts to any mobile phone without requiring the end users to install an app, and the app should also be able to send attachments, like a map showing where to meet, or perhapsd a photo, showing someone to BOLO.
